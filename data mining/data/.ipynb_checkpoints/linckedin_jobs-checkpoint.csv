However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Compensation and Benefits &lt;/strong&gt; *&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equity&lt;/strong&gt; - On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt; - Benefits we offer include:&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; 401(k) plan with 4% matching. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; 21 weeks of paid parental leave. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Fertility benefits via Carrot. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Daily lunches and snacks in our office. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic’s good faith estimate for this position, in San Francisco, CA, as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How We're Different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We're trying to build a core of knowledge and intuition about the most robustly effective innovations in AI, and so thoroughly-documented null results are almost as valuable as positive discoveries. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research .

We have spent over 40 years advocating for and creating a health-home for the many that have been denied access to care. As health care activists, we are dedicated to ensuring that individuals who do not have healthcare coverage receive the same quality healthcare as those who do.

Many times, this requires that we go outside and provide services in other settings that link individuals to our health center for preventive and primary care. Over 90,000 individuals come to La Clínica because it is a welcoming place that addresses the whole person, coordinating and connecting them to a broad network of services to improve and maintain their health and well-being.

Studies show that when carsharing is available, people drive less and drive vehicles more appropriate for their use case, which can reduce household carbon emissions by up to 40%. Also, shared cars are used more frequently and retired more quickly, accelerating the adoption of newer, more energy-efficient vehicles.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Our mission is to empower people to carshare everywhere by enabling the shift away from car ownership, want to join us?&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Opportunity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The Inventory Fulfillment &amp;amp; Logistics Specialist is responsible for processing twice weekly outbound fulfillment and inbound returns of our proprietary hardware and accessories, while providing proactive communication to ensure inventory levels are adequate.

We have spent our careers founding and scaling companies like Plaid, Square, SoFi, Blend, and Affirm, and have seen this problem firsthand — builders and developers needing to partner with traditional banks, and creating API and abstraction layers over the patchwork that is the bank, its core, and many other vendors. All of this results in a complex (and often expensive) banking supply chain involving a user, fintech, BaaS middleware provider, bank, core and the Federal Reserve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Column, we set out to simplify and fix this. We are a bank and a software company built from the ground up, offering builders and developers technology-forward banking solutions that cut out the hundreds of vendors, middleware providers, and abstraction layers. This means a safer, more transparent, and less costly banking supply chain. Come build with us!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The opportunity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We’re a lean and experienced team. We like our current size of six engineers. For an excellent candidate we’re open to hiring one or two more.

We generally prefer candidates with at least five years of production coding experience at a high caliber and high velocity team. We’ll require a take-home that does take time, so if that’s a non-starter for you we’re sorry. We find it the best way for you to show your skills, without being overly burdensome on the team!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We look forward to hearing from you&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Column is committed to working with the best and brightest people from the broadest talent pool possible.

Teams working in these domains have to deal with large streams of unstructured data (images, video, text and audio), exorbitant labeling costs, and broken feedback loops. For this next wave of ML applications, getting to production takes months and adapting to the long tail is an existential struggle.

In our personal lives, we have tools to help us find pretty much whatever we need. Why don't we have that at work? And that was the beginning of Glean.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Glean searches across all your company's apps to help you find exactly what you need and discover the things you should know. We're a diverse team of curious and creative people who want to help each other get big things done—so we can help other teams do the same.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;We're backed by some of the Silicon Valley's leading venture capitalists—including Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, and General Catalyst—and have assembled a world-class team with senior leadership experience at Google, Slack, Facebook, Dropbox, Rubrik, Uber, Intercom, Pinterest, Palantir, and others.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Glean is building a world-class data science org.

We build battery-based energy storage systems that provide clean and quiet power anywhere it’s needed, reducing the cost and accelerating deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure. FreeWire’s solutions are evolving from providing ultrafast EV charging services to a full suite of energy services to accelerate sustainable electrification and provide resiliency to customers and a distributed power source to utilities. FreeWire has secured major strategic investors from Fortune 100 companies and serves leading corporate, utility, and retail customers. The feedback on the Boost Charger, FreeWire’s DC fast charger, has been overwhelmingly positive as we electrify locations that would have been too expensive to power on using conventional charging solutions. Utilities are releasing RFPs with requests for battery backed solutions, their regulatory teams are including our technology as eligible for incentives, and they are seeking cost effective solutions as they electrify their fleets and provide utility owned charging solutions for the public.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;FreeWire has deployed battery-integrated chargers with Fortune 100 companies, commercial customers, fleets, retail locations, and gas stations. In addition to its partnership with bp pulse, FreeWire and am/pm, a bp subsidiary and convenience store chain with over 1,000 locations, have already deployed multiple public charging stations in the U.S. FreeWire’s regulatory affairs and policy team keeps customers up to date on federal, state, and utility incentive opportunities, which in some cases cover up to 80% of the cost of the charging station, and the company recently announced that the Boost Charger is Buy America compliant.

Despite broader economic headwinds, the continued proliferation of fintech companies and a 20x increase in fintech investment ($20.5 billion in 2020) signals that the market’s interest in embedding financial services products into their offerings is resilient and sustainable. Whether it’s a travel company that wants to offer credit for an expensive trip, a social network that wants to enable in-feed shopping solutions, or an ecommerce platform that wants to provide client rewards cards, the broader tech ecosystem has enjoyed a step-change in the sophistication, variety and complexity of client-facing products they can offer. This means that the underlying infrastructure powering those fintechs needs to evolve to meet these modern demands.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;While fintech companies continue pushing boundaries, they have largely accepted that directly integrating with banks is costly, time-consuming and operationally burdensome. This frustration comes in many forms: gaps in technical acumen, product scalability, client risk appetite, and company culture. These gaps clearly illustrate the need for a new paradigm in banking technology.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Lead Bank is bridging those gaps.

Observe ingests anything with a timestamp (e.g. system and application logs, metrics, and traces), and then structures that data so that it is correlated and easy to navigate. We enable engineers to spend more time coding features and less time investigating incidents. Finally, because of Observe’s unique elastic architecture, it is priced based on usage, making it cost 10x less than incumbents. Watch this video to learn more about our mission.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Traditional approaches to this problem have resulted in fragmented tooling and fragile dashboards which, in turn, have resulted in exploding costs and complexity. At Observe, we believe that the core challenge lies in organizing and relating telemetry data emitted by those applications, despite the fact it is constantly changing. Solving this data problem makes observability and order of magnitude easier, faster, and less expensive. At Observe, we didn’t set out to build another monitoring tool company, we set out to build a data company. Observe is founded by top enterprise VC Sutter Hill Ventures and has a founding team from leading Enterprise SaaS companies Snowflake, Splunk, and Wavefront.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;What does a Observability Engineer do?&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;You can’t fix what you can’t measure. Towards that end, Observe is looking for folks who can help us build 3rd-party integrations to ingest and make sense of streams of real-time operational telemetry (e.g. logs, performance metrics, events, etc.) from the diverse spectrum of infrastructure and applications that our customers run their businesses on: AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, CI/CD platforms, and whatever other critical software infrastructure a customer might have. Beyond collecting and storing the raw data from these sources, Observe adds structure and context to it, in order to help our users answer questions about the services and infrastructure they are responsible for (e.g. How are my APAC servers doing? Which users were affected by that outage?).&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;As a Software Engineer specializing in “Integrations” at Observe, your role would be to implement reusable solutions to connect the “last mile” between our customers’ critical infrastructure components and Observe’s flexible Observability platform.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design and develop applications to support collection and display of observability data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating and maintaining Observe “Dataset Packages” to structure and contextualize telemetry data we collect. For example, our package for AWS includes Datasets that relate EC2 Instances to Elastic Network Interfaces to VPCs to VPC Flow Logs. These relationships help short-circuit the process of troubleshooting or auditing this complex infrastructure. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Establishing best practices (or implementing whatever APIs are needed) in order to ingest real-time telemetry from a wide variety of sources. For example, we’ve recently built new API integrations for AWS Kinesis, Heroku LogPlex, Snowflake, and more. Our customers have a long tail of additional data sources they want to ingest in Observe, including Azure AKS, Jenkins, Harness, ServiceNow, and many, many more&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acting as a first line of support for our intrepid Sales Engineers as they work through the process of proving the value of Observe’s “Observability” solution in early customer engagements. You are not on the front line, but your work directly supports those who are&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Qualifications&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have shipped production code in a few languages. You are comfortable with creating, testing, peer reviewing, and releasing software in a CI/CD environment. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have experience with one or more of the following C++, Python, Go, Javascript&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have used or are familiar with the tools our customers are familiar with (e.g. Datadog, Grafana, Splunk, Nagios, etc.), and have practical knowledge about the high-level questions someone working in an Development, SRE or Ops role might have of their telemetry data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience configuring and deploying open-source data collectors (e.g. fluentd/fluentbit, logstash/filebeat, prometheus, telegraf, etc.) and/or building dashboards with Grafana, Kibana, Datadog, Tableau, or similar is a plus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience as an SRE or in an Ops capacity at some point in your career is a plus. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;About Us&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Observe's mission is to turn business data into information. Our SaaS Observability product ingests anything with a timestamp - logs, metrics, traces - and then curates and relates that data to provide unique insights into a customer’s data universe. If a customer has a problem on the application layer, engineering teams can seamlessly find the root cause of the issue whether that’s a new release pushed to production from Jenkins, or an underlying database or memory issue. We enable engineers to spend more time coding features and less time investigating incidents. We reduce outages and issues with customer experience. And we leverage an elastic cloud architecture so that customers only pay for what they use.

E.g. improving our component library or tools we use to translate the web app into 40+ languages. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;At some point in your life, someone has told you: “you write good code.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You know how to copy-paste code from Stack Overflow. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bonus: you have a good sense of humor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Padlet&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vision: Every child in the world will grow up with Mickey Mouse and Padlet. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Product: We are making the default way of collecting and sharing thoughts on the Internet. People love the product. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Impact: We have over 50 million active users making Padlet one of the most used apps on the planet. Our goal is to be THE the most used app on the planet. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Money: We are venture backed AND profitable. We are built to last one hundred years. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Badassery: We are 36 people (plus a baby crane that we've adopted but it doesn't really do much). That's over a million active users per employee. Some badass people work here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech stack&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Web: VueJS, Tailwind. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Backend: Ruby (Rails), Typescript, Elixir (Phoenix), and Python. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Storage: Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, Firestore, and Snowflake. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mobile apps: React Native (with Swift and Java where necessary.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joys of engineering at Padlet&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have very few meetings. We value keeping you in flow. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of people use Padlet. We have to solve interesting scale and concurrency problems. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our users are in over 200 countries, using all kinds of devices and connections, and speaking over 40 languages. We have to solve interesting internationalization problems. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We like to craft delightful user experiences. They’re satisfying to build. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We try to solve problems creatively instead of just throwing money at them. We are engineers! We thrive in constraints, not in the absence of them. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We ship often. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We value beautiful code. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sorrows of engineering at Padlet&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We grew pretty fast last year and our processes are still catching up. E.g. we don't have 100% code coverage yet. Our deployment process isn't as painless as it could be. This sometimes leads to spending time on things that aren't the most fun. We’re working on it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our project management process could be better. This sometimes leads to re-speccing in the middle of development, getting in the way of programming flow. We’re working on it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people you'd work with&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Josh Hewitt: insists that wallabies and kangaroos are different animals, artificially inflating the biodiversity of his homeland. Is excellent at surgically improving an existing, complicated system. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Colin Teahan: lives for one-liners. E.g: Colleague: “Wouldn’t it be funny if Iron Man were anemic?” Teahan: “It would be IRONIC.” Single-handedly wrote early versions of our iOS and Android apps. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The office&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our office is in the middle of Presidio, a beautiful national park. We’re 5 minutes from the beach, a walk we take often. The WiFi works outdoors. You can work sitting in a lawn overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The office itself is designed to be a space for all your interests and hobbies. We have a meditation room, game room, library, podcasting studio, art studio, kids room, and full makerspace with 3d printers, presses, laser cutters, sewing machines, and more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top tier medical, dental, and vision insurance for you and your family. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One Medical and Cue memberships for you and your family. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;401(k) with matching. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Commuter benefits. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;FSA. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good stock options. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Catered lunches and dinners. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;20 vacation days. Plus sickness and bereavement days for when life happens. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All the gadgetry you need, including a new phone every year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special time to join&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Because we're small, there's a lot of energy. And because we have tremendous traction, your first commit touches millions.
