💎 My 1st client - $18K Earnings - ""Rohini is attentive, honest, and works with integrity. She takes great pride in her work and wants to make sure the job is done well. Great hire!"" - Eden Broggie

💎""Rohini's talent and experience as a recruitment agency assistant immediately shined. She quickly learned our process and became integral to our company's functionality.

Being an aviation recruitment agency, there is usually a learning curve to learning aircraft names and codes. Still, Rohini learned them very quickly and spoke of them with tremendous confidence.

I cannot recommend Rohini enough; her positive attitude and wide range of knowledge will be an asset to any organization.

We will be working with Rohini again very soon."" - Burke Mckenzie

💎""Rohini worked diligently to find and apply for jobs in my field. Most of these jobs were perfect! She utilized my resume and cover letters. I received so many job interviews based on her hard work. I didn’t require her to keep a regular schedule, but she did on her own and informed me if she wouldn’t be able to work or work an extended amount of time. I’d recommend her for good work and excellent communication."" - Thelma Syed

Offering support with the tedious data entry of transferring bank statements to excel for uploading to your preferred software program!

Receipt keying to stay on top of all expenses throughout the year. 
Invoice generation. 
Or whatever else you may need! Price is depending on the job! (the $15 is a placeholder for smaller jobs, per 15 min increment) 

I am happy to work with both personnel and companies needing extra data support. I hope to hear from you soon!




PLEASE NOTE... I have finished every job I have taken 100%. Upworks calculates contracts being open and hours are taken. I leave contracts open for ""as needed"" Upwork clients so it pulls down my rate some, but just know that I will always finish a project!

also** my rate is $20 min.. the rate of $15 is for projects that take anywhere from a min to 45min :) THANKS FOR READING!

I am ready and available to get started on all projects and assist you with your admin needs! Short and/or unexpected deadlines are welcome!

DATA ENTRY - ALL 
PDF or (scanned documents) to word-excel conversion (or google doc-sheets)
Copy typing (like an old manuscript that needs to be editable in word)
Formatting of documents, (your document won’t format right, I can fix it)
Legal - lease agreements
Back data entry to get your company caught up.
** coming soon, fillable forms and Adobe InDesign 
Basic bookkeeping (data entry) (like QuickBooks online = I have light bookkeeping knowledge of debits, credits, categorizing, and taxes for SMALL business owners)
Creating Excel sheets. 

Scanned documents can include
Pics, handwritten, web pages, old pdfs, etc
Really anything you don’t have time to type up or fix I can do it. If you have in-house software that needs to have data entry I can access it online. I can do it!
Rates for data entry go from $15 - $30 for formatting. ((But please feel free to message me to discuss any rates!)) I work with a lot of one-time projects for one set price. 

TRANSCRIPTION
Zoom calls, meetings, lectures, audio, and spoken notes. 
$rates are depending on the type of transcription needed.
(live meetings when needed, if available)

Translation - Mexico Spanish 
Spanish to English transcripts/translations.
English to Spanish transcripts - document translations. 
** I do not do Spanish transcriptions. (UNLESS) you just need notes from the transcription, but I do not do verbatim Spanish audio to Spanish documents. 

EVEN IF YOU NEED ME TO JUST DO A VOICEOVER, LOOK AT YOUR NEW APP OR QUESTIONNAIRE I CAN DO THIS! NOTHING IS TOO BIG OR TOO SMALL.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

❝ Valiotti Analytics helped us build a new data pipeline from scratch, replacing legacy tools such as Pentaho IDE with modern ones. They suggested the implementation of a modern data warehouse architecture for analytics and tuned instances to work with software. They also reacted quickly and introduced a huge number of improvements in the data analysis structure of our company. Moreover, several useful analytic dashboards were built for us during the project. We appreciate their approach as they tend to dive deeply into the crucial details and understand business constraints to immediately react to data failure. In order to support the new data stack, the team helped us build a monitoring system for the data routine. We are sincerely pleased to work together with Valiotti Analytics. ❞

248,"It has been my lifelong ambition to become an independent scientist at the forefront of biomechanical research. I studied Mechanical Engineering, graduating with the first class while also volunteering as a research trainee. I then pursued my PhD in Thermal and Fluid Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Amit Agrawal, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Bombay, India.  My thesis, entitled ‘Low Reynolds number External Flow around bio-inspired objects: Effect of Geometric Shape and Surface Modification on Drag Reduction’, focused on the passive flow control mechanisms attained using both shape and surface modifications inspired by insects to understand flow control mechanisms in the low Reynolds number regime. The results of my study revealed that a bio-inspired corrugated airfoil based on a dragonfly wing shows superior aerodynamic performance in the low Reynolds number regime. Further, wake analysis was conducted to understand the flow physics and flow structures in the wake. A comprehensive experimental investigation was carried out using 2D PIV and flow visualisation. I was awarded the Excellence in PhD research award 2018-2020 by the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, India. Later I took on a postdoctoral position to study to elucidate the correlation between large scale structures and flow separation in a boundary layer flow to control the flow separation using Particle image velocimetry (PIV) and Computational Fluid Dynamics. My Engineering background and experience working with bioinspired flight dynamics make me uniquely suitable to successfully conduct the research proposed here. I published ten peer-reviewed articles in prominent journals, including the Journal of Fluid Mechanics, with a total of over 100 citations to date and an h-index of 6 (source: Google Scholar), showing proficiency in research. I have presented my work at international and national conferences on seven occasions, most of which are related to insect flight dynamics and fish swimming.

Case studies of the customers I have worked with:
🔸Safe and Cost-Effective Infrastructure to Bring One-Click Deployment For a Cyber-Security Provider:
Deployment time decreased from 8 hours to 10 minutes (48x faster deployment). Fewer resources (time/costs/employee-hours) are now required as code deployment has moved from a tedious, manual process to a codified, automated mechanism.

🔸Backend Infrastructure Design & Development for all-in-one connectivity platform for restaurants & stores:
Product provisioning time shortened from 1,5 weeks to 1 hour. Company can drive much more value to their customers now, due to being able to provision the product 200-300 times a month, instead of 5-6 monthly deployments. System redesign and automation allowed to save 30-35% of the budget and free the internal resources for more important tasks.

306,"I am a writer that focuses on resumes, LinkedIn profiles, cover letters, corporate bios, and various business content (websites, marketing materials) for clients. I also have expertise in job search tactics and strategy and offer clients help via one-on-one coaching services over Skype or phone. 

My specialty is technology resumes for the US market targeting start ups (Silicon Valley / San Francisco Bay Area and across the US) with many successes at big name companies (Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, FAANG, et al.). I've also written hundreds of resumes and CVs for global clients from CEO to junior roles across industries including law, marketing, finance, entertainment, and healthcare. My technology clients range from CTO and CIO level, entrepreneurs and founders, product managers, data scientists, software engineers, project managers, infosec, testers, etc.

I'm different than most resume writers in that I have 20 years of hiring experience as a recruiter for US startups, so I have deep knowledge of the resume's intended audience. I know how the mind of a recruiter functions - why they stop reading a resume, what gets their interest, etc. - and I leverage that expertise when writing for my clients.

I have had many articles on tech career topics (resumes, interviews, markets) published and/or cited by Lifehacker, Fast Company, WSJ Online, American Management Association, Tech Beacon, DZone, et al. My former blog (now inactive) is JobTipsForGeeks.com, and I published a job search ebook Job Tips For Geeks: The Job Search (available on Amazon).

I'm 'fecak' on Hacker News and active on Reddit's /r/resumes as 'resumeraidersDOTcom' where I help job seekers with targeted advice on resumes and job search strategy. I'm also a former moderator at /r/cscareerquestions under my own handle 'fecak'.
