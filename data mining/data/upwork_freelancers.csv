Clients Testimonial:

💎 My 1st client - $18K Earnings - ""Rohini is attentive, honest, and works with integrity. She takes great pride in her work and wants to make sure the job is done well. Great hire!"" - Eden Broggie

💎""Rohini's talent and experience as a recruitment agency assistant immediately shined. She quickly learned our process and became integral to our company's functionality.

Being an aviation recruitment agency, there is usually a learning curve to learning aircraft names and codes. Still, Rohini learned them very quickly and spoke of them with tremendous confidence.

I cannot recommend Rohini enough; her positive attitude and wide range of knowledge will be an asset to any organization.

We will be working with Rohini again very soon."" - Burke Mckenzie

💎""Rohini worked diligently to find and apply for jobs in my field. Most of these jobs were perfect! She utilized my resume and cover letters. I received so many job interviews based on her hard work. I didn’t require her to keep a regular schedule, but she did on her own and informed me if she wouldn’t be able to work or work an extended amount of time. I’d recommend her for good work and excellent communication."" - Thelma Syed

❝ Valiotti Analytics helped us build a new data pipeline from scratch, replacing legacy tools such as Pentaho IDE with modern ones. They suggested the implementation of a modern data warehouse architecture for analytics and tuned instances to work with software. They also reacted quickly and introduced a huge number of improvements in the data analysis structure of our company. Moreover, several useful analytic dashboards were built for us during the project. We appreciate their approach as they tend to dive deeply into the crucial details and understand business constraints to immediately react to data failure.

148,"It has been my lifelong ambition to become an independent scientist at the forefront of biomechanical research. I studied Mechanical Engineering, graduating with the first class while also volunteering as a research trainee. I then pursued my PhD in Thermal and Fluid Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Amit Agrawal, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Bombay, India.  My thesis, entitled ‘Low Reynolds number External Flow around bio-inspired objects: Effect of Geometric Shape and Surface Modification on Drag Reduction’, focused on the passive flow control mechanisms attained using both shape and surface modifications inspired by insects to understand flow control mechanisms in the low Reynolds number regime. The results of my study revealed that a bio-inspired corrugated airfoil based on a dragonfly wing shows superior aerodynamic performance in the low Reynolds number regime. Further, wake analysis was conducted to understand the flow physics and flow structures in the wake. A comprehensive experimental investigation was carried out using 2D PIV and flow visualisation. I was awarded the Excellence in PhD research award 2018-2020 by the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, India. Later I took on a postdoctoral position to study to elucidate the correlation between large scale structures and flow separation in a boundary layer flow to control the flow separation using Particle image velocimetry (PIV) and Computational Fluid Dynamics. My Engineering background and experience working with bioinspired flight dynamics make me uniquely suitable to successfully conduct the research proposed here. I published ten peer-reviewed articles in prominent journals, including the Journal of Fluid Mechanics, with a total of over 100 citations to date and an h-index of 6 (source: Google Scholar), showing proficiency in research. I have presented my work at international and national conferences on seven occasions, most of which are related to insect flight dynamics and fish swimming. Throughout my training, I have shown independence, developing novel technologies and addressing controversies.

Case studies of the customers I have worked with:
🔸Safe and Cost-Effective Infrastructure to Bring One-Click Deployment For a Cyber-Security Provider:
Deployment time decreased from 8 hours to 10 minutes (48x faster deployment). Fewer resources (time/costs/employee-hours) are now required as code deployment has moved from a tedious, manual process to a codified, automated mechanism.

🔸Backend Infrastructure Design & Development for all-in-one connectivity platform for restaurants & stores:
Product provisioning time shortened from 1,5 weeks to 1 hour. Company can drive much more value to their customers now, due to being able to provision the product 200-300 times a month, instead of 5-6 monthly deployments. System redesign and automation allowed to save 30-35% of the budget and free the internal resources for more important tasks.

➡️Performed facial expression recognition of 3D facial expression datasets, utilizing both point clouds and surface patches to improve accuracy on emotion recognition. The approach achieved better recognition accuracy by combining these methods.
➡️Developed an eye state detection framework for driver fatigue detection as a part of my master's thesis. The approach used a Haar cascade approach for face and eye localization, while circular Hough detection algorithm was used to detect eye openness state. This approach is able to alert on driver fatigue.
➡️Developed an LSTM-based stock price forecaster using features derived from candlesticks. The features were formed with the help of an expert mathematician using 5m, 10m, 1h, 4h, and 1d candle data.

✅ Accuracy:
When it comes to timeline and price, developers are notorious for underestimating. To rectify this I have put together a system(involving timeline/Gantt charts, among others) that shows you a snapshot of your project status every week, I also offer weekly screen-share demos so you can see the website’s progress and experiment yourself. 
✅ Integrity:
I will always be honest with you and offer the best solutions for your business. I measure my success based off of my client’s success. This is the driving value behind all of my decisions.
✅ Communication:
I will actively listen to you, read between the lines, and ask specific questions where things are unclear. Understanding your vision and having a ‘meeting of the minds’ is my number one priority before I start any work. 
✅Cost Savings:
I have pre-built solutions I’ve compiled over the years that I use for most clients. It typically shaves off 10-50% of the total cost - depending on the overlap with your unique project needs. 📞 Schedule a call and I’d be happy to share it with you 📞
✅Reliability:
I am always looking to build long-lasting solutions for my clients and support them as their business grows. I take responsibility for the projects I work on and am always available for a call, even months or years later. 

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️❝Andrew was absolutely INCREDIBLE to work with. I hired Andrew to quickly develop a prototype/proof of concept for me, in a very short window of time. The project itself required an extremely high level of technical knowledge, and Andrew blasted through it very quickly. He anticipated needs, worked thoroughly, and the communication between us was always wonderful. I would highly, highly recommend work with him.❞
