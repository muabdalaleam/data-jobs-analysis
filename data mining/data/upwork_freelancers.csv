💎 My 1st client - $18K Earnings - ""Rohini is attentive, honest, and works with integrity. She takes great pride in her work and wants to make sure the job is done well. Great hire!"" - Eden Broggie

💎""Rohini's talent and experience as a recruitment agency assistant immediately shined. She quickly learned our process and became integral to our company's functionality.

Being an aviation recruitment agency, there is usually a learning curve to learning aircraft names and codes. Still, Rohini learned them very quickly and spoke of them with tremendous confidence.

I cannot recommend Rohini enough; her positive attitude and wide range of knowledge will be an asset to any organization.

We will be working with Rohini again very soon."" - Burke Mckenzie

💎""Rohini worked diligently to find and apply for jobs in my field. Most of these jobs were perfect! She utilized my resume and cover letters. I received so many job interviews based on her hard work. I didn’t require her to keep a regular schedule, but she did on her own and informed me if she wouldn’t be able to work or work an extended amount of time. I’d recommend her for good work and excellent communication."" - Thelma Syed

I have a great deal of administrative experience in many areas including e-commerce management, product research, product listing description writing, product cross listing, graphic design, research, data entry and database management. I am skilled in Microsoft and Google Office software programs, Airtable, Canva, and other software programs. 

A recent experience includes work in the e-commerce field including product research, graphic design, setting up, and managing e-commerce print on demand stores. I also have experience with keyword and design research, and also listing copy-writing creation, data entry, and database management. I have experience researching, writing product listings , and uploading for Merch by Amazon, Ebay, Mercari, Poshmark, and other e-commerce platforms.

One experience in the E-commerce field included doing extensive niche and SEO keyword research for print on demand merchandise. I started with checking trends and other places to come up with niche ideas. I then checked the selling metrics, including sales rankings, number of current products on the platform, trademarks, and other specified criteria to see if the niche would be a good one to pursue. Once it was approved I would come up with an idea for the graphic, and begin more in depth keyword research. This research would be what I used to write the product listing descriptions that would be uploaded to the platform along with the graphic to complete the t-shirt and other merchandise listing.

I also had the opportunity to open and manage online print on demand merchandise stores, personal stores and for an author using fan submitted artwork. I have been responsible for everything from setting up the website, entering into contracts with artists, to data and financial management including paying out commission royalties. I am also responsible for social media marketing, outreach and advertising. I also have experience with keyword and design research, and also listing copy-writing creation, and database management in this field.

I have extensive research experience along with data entry experience. A recent contact research and data entry experience includes researching and updating a database of contacts that met a specified criteria on Linkedin. I used Crelate to update and add contacts to the database when they met the criteria I was researching and also verified contacts that were already in the databases to ensure they were up to date and accurate.

A recent company research and data entry project I worked on is one that consisted of doing an extensive internet search to locate businesses that offer people discounts and special offers when they sign up for text messages. I did internet research for specific companies and went through thousands of websites to see if text specials were offered. I also signed up for marketing messages to verify if the text specials were valid. I also went further in depth with the  company research to find business names and their DBA information. I also created an Excel spreadsheet with multiple tabs to organize the data I was finding and to keep track of all of the businesses that met the criteria. I set this up so the client was able to easily find exactly what they were looking for and added more criteria as needed. . I used Google, Zoominfo, Linkedin, Crunchbase, Dun and Bradstreet,Seamless Ai, Rocket Reach and other databases to do this research.",,98,Mary B K.,E-Commerce Research Data Entry Lead Generation Admin Virtual Assistant,United States,$24.00,Doesn't offer consultations,"['Data Entry', 'Product Listings', 'Ecommerce', 'Database Management', 'Keyword Research', 'Company Research', 'eBay Listing', 'Etsy Listing', 'Product Description', 'SEO Keyword Research', 'Contact List', 'Search Engine Optimization', 'Lead Generation']",Data entry

❝ Valiotti Analytics helped us build a new data pipeline from scratch, replacing legacy tools such as Pentaho IDE with modern ones. They suggested the implementation of a modern data warehouse architecture for analytics and tuned instances to work with software. They also reacted quickly and introduced a huge number of improvements in the data analysis structure of our company. Moreover, several useful analytic dashboards were built for us during the project.

327,"I am a data scientist who specializes in digital marketing analytics, Google Analytics 4 / Google Tag Manager, and customer behavioral analysis. 

I work primarily with e-commerce brands and B2Bs, but I also work with businesses in industries such as legal and professional services and real estate as well. 

I've recently completed GA4 projects for clients such as Vista Equity Partners, NASCAR, USAA, and AARP.

Web analytics tools, such as Google Analytics 4 and Google Tag Manager, play an indispensable role in today's business landscape. 

By tracking and analyzing user behavior, interaction patterns, and key performance indicators, these tools provide actionable insights that can drive decision-making and strategic planning. 

Understanding where visitors come from, what content they engage with, how they navigate through a site, and at what point they might leave, can uncover areas for optimization, allowing businesses to refine their marketing strategies, improve user experience, and increase conversion rates. 

Additionally, with real-time reporting, organizations can respond to trends quickly, adapting to market changes and maintaining a competitive edge. In an age where data-driven decisions are paramount to success, the investment in web analytics tools can often translate into increased revenue, customer retention, and overall business growth.

Google Analytics 4 (GA4) offers a host of advanced features and integrations that can provide valuable business intelligence to drive revenue. Here's how:

1. **Real-Time Data Analysis**: GA4's real-time reporting enables businesses to respond to trends and customer behaviors as they happen. This allows for immediate adjustments to marketing strategies or website content, ensuring optimal engagement and conversion.

2. **Audience Segmentation**: By understanding the different segments of an audience, businesses can create targeted marketing campaigns that resonate with specific groups. GA4's audience segmentation tools help identify these segments based on behavior, demographics, and interests, allowing for more personalized and effective marketing.

3. **Cross-Platform Tracking**: GA4's ability to track users across different devices and platforms gives a more holistic view of the customer journey. This can reveal insights into how different touchpoints influence purchasing decisions, enabling a more coordinated and efficient marketing approach.

4. **Predictive Metrics**: GA4 uses machine learning to offer predictive metrics, such as potential revenue from particular audience segments. This helps businesses to focus their efforts on the most promising areas, optimizing their return on investment.

5. **Enhanced Ecommerce Tracking**: By closely monitoring how users interact with products on a website, GA4 provides insights into which products are most appealing, the effectiveness of product recommendations, shopping cart abandonment rates, and more. This information is vital for optimizing product placement, pricing strategies, and overall ecommerce effectiveness.

6. **Integration with Advertising Platforms**: GA4's seamless integration with various advertising platforms, like Google Ads, means that businesses can manage and measure their advertising efforts within a unified environment. This ensures more precise targeting and measurement, driving a more efficient use of advertising budget.

7. **Custom Reporting and Dashboards**: GA4 allows for customized reporting that aligns with specific business goals and KPIs. This flexibility ensures that businesses have ready access to the most relevant data, empowering them to make informed decisions that align with their revenue-driving objectives.

8. **Compliance and Data Privacy**: With increased concerns over data privacy, GA4 has features to help businesses comply with regulations like GDPR. By maintaining compliance, businesses reduce the risk of legal issues that could impact revenue and reputation.

9. **Event Tracking and Automation**: GA4's event tracking capabilities allow businesses to understand user interactions at a granular level, such as clicks on specific buttons or form submissions. These insights can lead to the automation of specific responses, further optimizing user engagement and conversion pathways.

By leveraging these features, businesses can extract actionable insights, refine their strategies, and make data-driven decisions that align with their goals, ultimately leading to increased revenue.",$900k+,100,Thomas P.,Data Scientist | Google Analytics | Looker Studio | Google Ads | SEO,United States,$150.00,Offers consultations,"['Offers consultations', 'Data Analysis', 'Google Ads', 'Search Engine Optimization', 'Data Science', 'Data Modeling', 'Facebook Ads Manager', 'Data Visualization', 'Domo', 'Looker Studio', 'Data Mining', 'Paid Media', 'Machine Learning', 'Data Cleaning']",Data engineer

382,"I am a data scientist who specializes in digital marketing analytics, Google Analytics 4 / Google Tag Manager, and customer behavioral analysis. 

I work primarily with e-commerce brands and B2Bs, but I also work with businesses in industries such as legal and professional services and real estate as well. 

I've recently completed GA4 projects for clients such as Vista Equity Partners, NASCAR, USAA, and AARP.

Web analytics tools, such as Google Analytics 4 and Google Tag Manager, play an indispensable role in today's business landscape. 

By tracking and analyzing user behavior, interaction patterns, and key performance indicators, these tools provide actionable insights that can drive decision-making and strategic planning. 

Understanding where visitors come from, what content they engage with, how they navigate through a site, and at what point they might leave, can uncover areas for optimization, allowing businesses to refine their marketing strategies, improve user experience, and increase conversion rates. 

Additionally, with real-time reporting, organizations can respond to trends quickly, adapting to market changes and maintaining a competitive edge. In an age where data-driven decisions are paramount to success, the investment in web analytics tools can often translate into increased revenue, customer retention, and overall business growth.

Google Analytics 4 (GA4) offers a host of advanced features and integrations that can provide valuable business intelligence to drive revenue. Here's how:

1. **Real-Time Data Analysis**: GA4's real-time reporting enables businesses to respond to trends and customer behaviors as they happen. This allows for immediate adjustments to marketing strategies or website content, ensuring optimal engagement and conversion.

2. **Audience Segmentation**: By understanding the different segments of an audience, businesses can create targeted marketing campaigns that resonate with specific groups. GA4's audience segmentation tools help identify these segments based on behavior, demographics, and interests, allowing for more personalized and effective marketing.

3. **Cross-Platform Tracking**: GA4's ability to track users across different devices and platforms gives a more holistic view of the customer journey. This can reveal insights into how different touchpoints influence purchasing decisions, enabling a more coordinated and efficient marketing approach.

4. **Predictive Metrics**: GA4 uses machine learning to offer predictive metrics, such as potential revenue from particular audience segments. This helps businesses to focus their efforts on the most promising areas, optimizing their return on investment.

5. **Enhanced Ecommerce Tracking**: By closely monitoring how users interact with products on a website, GA4 provides insights into which products are most appealing, the effectiveness of product recommendations, shopping cart abandonment rates, and more. This information is vital for optimizing product placement, pricing strategies, and overall ecommerce effectiveness.

6. **Integration with Advertising Platforms**: GA4's seamless integration with various advertising platforms, like Google Ads, means that businesses can manage and measure their advertising efforts within a unified environment. This ensures more precise targeting and measurement, driving a more efficient use of advertising budget.

7. **Custom Reporting and Dashboards**: GA4 allows for customized reporting that aligns with specific business goals and KPIs. This flexibility ensures that businesses have ready access to the most relevant data, empowering them to make informed decisions that align with their revenue-driving objectives.

8. **Compliance and Data Privacy**: With increased concerns over data privacy, GA4 has features to help businesses comply with regulations like GDPR. By maintaining compliance, businesses reduce the risk of legal issues that could impact revenue and reputation.

9. **Event Tracking and Automation**: GA4's event tracking capabilities allow businesses to understand user interactions at a granular level, such as clicks on specific buttons or form submissions. These insights can lead to the automation of specific responses, further optimizing user engagement and conversion pathways.

By leveraging these features, businesses can extract actionable insights, refine their strategies, and make data-driven decisions that align with their goals, ultimately leading to increased revenue.",$900k+,100,Thomas P.,Data Scientist | Google Analytics | Looker Studio | Google Ads | SEO,United States,$150.00,Offers consultations,"['Offers consultations', 'Data Analysis', 'Data Mining', 'Data Science', 'Machine Learning', 'Google Ads', 'Search Engine Optimization', 'Data Modeling', 'Facebook Ads Manager', 'Data Visualization', 'Domo', 'Looker Studio', 'Paid Media', 'Data Cleaning']",Data scientist

568,"My goal is to make your business more profits by blending the art of digital marketing with the science of robust analytics. Having collaborated with hundreds of marketing agencies, I've pinpointed a frequent challenge: the lack of precise conversion tracking. While many marketers craft compelling campaigns, they often grapple with accurately gauging their true impact due to insufficient analytics setups.

With a solid background in marketing analytics, I've made it my mission to bridge this gap. 

My specialty is not just crafting impactful paid and social ad campaigns, but meticulously intertwining them with precision analytics. I ensure that every click, impression, and conversion from your ads is not just captured, but also interpreted with razor-sharp accuracy. This dual prowess means your ad strategies aren’t based solely on creativity & intuition—they’re bolstered by real-time, actionable data, setting you apart in the digital marketplace.

By partnering with me, you’re ensuring that every advertising dollar is data-informed. You'll not only understand the ‘what’ of your data but the ‘why’ behind it. The result? Strategies that are as informed as they are creative, campaigns that resonate, and a return on investment that truly reflects your marketing prowess.

675,"I am a data scientist who specializes in digital marketing analytics, Google Analytics 4 / Google Tag Manager, and customer behavioral analysis. 

I work primarily with e-commerce brands and B2Bs, but I also work with businesses in industries such as legal and professional services and real estate as well. 

I've recently completed GA4 projects for clients such as Vista Equity Partners, NASCAR, USAA, and AARP.

Web analytics tools, such as Google Analytics 4 and Google Tag Manager, play an indispensable role in today's business landscape. 

By tracking and analyzing user behavior, interaction patterns, and key performance indicators, these tools provide actionable insights that can drive decision-making and strategic planning. 

Understanding where visitors come from, what content they engage with, how they navigate through a site, and at what point they might leave, can uncover areas for optimization, allowing businesses to refine their marketing strategies, improve user experience, and increase conversion rates. 

Additionally, with real-time reporting, organizations can respond to trends quickly, adapting to market changes and maintaining a competitive edge. In an age where data-driven decisions are paramount to success, the investment in web analytics tools can often translate into increased revenue, customer retention, and overall business growth.

Google Analytics 4 (GA4) offers a host of advanced features and integrations that can provide valuable business intelligence to drive revenue. Here's how:

1. **Real-Time Data Analysis**: GA4's real-time reporting enables businesses to respond to trends and customer behaviors as they happen. This allows for immediate adjustments to marketing strategies or website content, ensuring optimal engagement and conversion.

2. **Audience Segmentation**: By understanding the different segments of an audience, businesses can create targeted marketing campaigns that resonate with specific groups. GA4's audience segmentation tools help identify these segments based on behavior, demographics, and interests, allowing for more personalized and effective marketing.

3. **Cross-Platform Tracking**: GA4's ability to track users across different devices and platforms gives a more holistic view of the customer journey. This can reveal insights into how different touchpoints influence purchasing decisions, enabling a more coordinated and efficient marketing approach.

4. **Predictive Metrics**: GA4 uses machine learning to offer predictive metrics, such as potential revenue from particular audience segments. This helps businesses to focus their efforts on the most promising areas, optimizing their return on investment.

5. **Enhanced Ecommerce Tracking**: By closely monitoring how users interact with products on a website, GA4 provides insights into which products are most appealing, the effectiveness of product recommendations, shopping cart abandonment rates, and more. This information is vital for optimizing product placement, pricing strategies, and overall ecommerce effectiveness.

6. **Integration with Advertising Platforms**: GA4's seamless integration with various advertising platforms, like Google Ads, means that businesses can manage and measure their advertising efforts within a unified environment. This ensures more precise targeting and measurement, driving a more efficient use of advertising budget.

7. **Custom Reporting and Dashboards**: GA4 allows for customized reporting that aligns with specific business goals and KPIs. This flexibility ensures that businesses have ready access to the most relevant data, empowering them to make informed decisions that align with their revenue-driving objectives.

8. **Compliance and Data Privacy**: With increased concerns over data privacy, GA4 has features to help businesses comply with regulations like GDPR. By maintaining compliance, businesses reduce the risk of legal issues that could impact revenue and reputation.

9. **Event Tracking and Automation**: GA4's event tracking capabilities allow businesses to understand user interactions at a granular level, such as clicks on specific buttons or form submissions. These insights can lead to the automation of specific responses, further optimizing user engagement and conversion pathways.

By leveraging these features, businesses can extract actionable insights, refine their strategies, and make data-driven decisions that align with their goals, ultimately leading to increased revenue.",$900k+,100,Thomas P.,Data Scientist | Google Analytics | Looker Studio | Google Ads | SEO,United States,$150.00,Offers consultations,"['Offers consultations', 'Data Analysis', 'Data Cleaning', 'Data Mining', 'Data Science', 'Google Ads', 'Search Engine Optimization', 'Data Modeling', 'Facebook Ads Manager', 'Data Visualization', 'Domo', 'Looker Studio', 'Paid Media', 'Machine Learning']",Data analyst

I've recently completed GA4 projects for clients such as Vista Equity Partners, NASCAR, USAA, and AARP.

Web analytics tools, such as Google Analytics 4 and Google Tag Manager, play an indispensable role in today's business landscape. 

By tracking and analyzing user behavior, interaction patterns, and key performance indicators, these tools provide actionable insights that can drive decision-making and strategic planning. 

Understanding where visitors come from, what content they engage with, how they navigate through a site, and at what point they might leave, can uncover areas for optimization, allowing businesses to refine their marketing strategies, improve user experience, and increase conversion rates. 

Additionally, with real-time reporting, organizations can respond to trends quickly, adapting to market changes and maintaining a competitive edge. In an age where data-driven decisions are paramount to success, the investment in web analytics tools can often translate into increased revenue, customer retention, and overall business growth.

Google Analytics 4 (GA4) offers a host of advanced features and integrations that can provide valuable business intelligence to drive revenue. Here's how:

1. **Real-Time Data Analysis**: GA4's real-time reporting enables businesses to respond to trends and customer behaviors as they happen. This allows for immediate adjustments to marketing strategies or website content, ensuring optimal engagement and conversion.

2. **Audience Segmentation**: By understanding the different segments of an audience, businesses can create targeted marketing campaigns that resonate with specific groups. GA4's audience segmentation tools help identify these segments based on behavior, demographics, and interests, allowing for more personalized and effective marketing.

3. **Cross-Platform Tracking**: GA4's ability to track users across different devices and platforms gives a more holistic view of the customer journey. This can reveal insights into how different touchpoints influence purchasing decisions, enabling a more coordinated and efficient marketing approach.

4. **Predictive Metrics**: GA4 uses machine learning to offer predictive metrics, such as potential revenue from particular audience segments. This helps businesses to focus their efforts on the most promising areas, optimizing their return on investment.

5. **Enhanced Ecommerce Tracking**: By closely monitoring how users interact with products on a website, GA4 provides insights into which products are most appealing, the effectiveness of product recommendations, shopping cart abandonment rates, and more. This information is vital for optimizing product placement, pricing strategies, and overall ecommerce effectiveness.

6. **Integration with Advertising Platforms**: GA4's seamless integration with various advertising platforms, like Google Ads, means that businesses can manage and measure their advertising efforts within a unified environment. This ensures more precise targeting and measurement, driving a more efficient use of advertising budget.

7. **Custom Reporting and Dashboards**: GA4 allows for customized reporting that aligns with specific business goals and KPIs. This flexibility ensures that businesses have ready access to the most relevant data, empowering them to make informed decisions that align with their revenue-driving objectives.

8. **Compliance and Data Privacy**: With increased concerns over data privacy, GA4 has features to help businesses comply with regulations like GDPR. By maintaining compliance, businesses reduce the risk of legal issues that could impact revenue and reputation.

9. **Event Tracking and Automation**: GA4's event tracking capabilities allow businesses to understand user interactions at a granular level, such as clicks on specific buttons or form submissions. These insights can lead to the automation of specific responses, further optimizing user engagement and conversion pathways.
