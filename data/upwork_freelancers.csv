🗣❝ Anas is simply the best person I have ever come across. Apart from being an exceptional tech genius, he is a man of utmost stature. 

We blasted off with our startup, high on dreams and code. We were mere steps from the MVP. Then, pandemic crash. Team bailed, funding dried up. Me and my partner were stranded and dread gnawed at us. A hefty chunk of cash, Anas and his team's livelihood, hung in the balance, It felt like a betrayal.

We scheduled a meeting with Anas to let him know we were quitting and request to repay him gradually over a year, he heard us out. Then, something magical happened. A smile. ""Forget it,"" he said, not a flicker of doubt in his voice. ""The project matters. Let's make it happen!""
We were floored. This guy, owed a small fortune, just waved it away? Not only that, he offered to keep building, even pulled his team in to replace our vanished crew.
As he spoke, his passion was a spark that reignited us. He believed. In us. In our dream. In what he had developed so far.

That's the day Anas became our partner. Not just a contractor, but a brother in arms. Our success story owes its spark not to our own leap of faith, but from the guy who had every reason to walk away.

My core capabilities include designing end-to-end data pipelines, advanced data modelling, and optimizing distributed systems for scale using tools like Apache Spark, Talend, Informatica, Apache NiFi, and Snowflake. I regularly work with orchestration tools like Apache Airflow, Luigi, and AWS Step Functions, as well as Kafka for real-time data streaming. I’ve successfully architected AI-ready infrastructure that feeds into ML and GenAI applications.

On the AI front, I’ve been building and deploying GenAI applications using OpenAI’s GPT models, LangChain, and LLM-powered agents for enterprise automation and advanced data querying. I have hands-on experience developing context-aware data agents, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, and integrating unstructured data into LLM workflows. My familiarity with vector databases like FAISS, Pinecone, and Weaviate has enabled scalable implementations of intelligent search and knowledge-based systems.

My strong foundation in Python—alongside libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Dask, PySpark, and TensorFlow—supports both traditional analytics and AI model development.
