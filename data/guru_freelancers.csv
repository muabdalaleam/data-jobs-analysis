An accomplished IT professional with over 20 years of hands-on experience, my career has centered on data, specializing in modernizing legacy systems and architecting robust, scalable solutions. Starting with a foundation in Oracle PL/SQL, I’ve developed a passion for building high-performance, elegant systems. I've spent two decades transforming complex data for some of the biggest names in the business, consistently serving as a trusted advisor and technical leader. My professional story is defined by a track record of success in large, complex transactional environments. I am particularly proud of projects where I took on significant challenges, such as re-engineering an entire suite of legacy COBOL programs into modern PL/SQL packages. This wasn't just a code migration; it was a deep dive into archaic business logic to build a solution that was more efficient and maintainable. I’ve also led and contributed to multiple large-scale data migrations, including a recent project involving over 3 million policies. My role encompassed developing proof-of-concepts, designing data frameworks, and implementing rigorous data reconciliation to ensure data integrity at every step. My values are rooted in a belief that technology should be elegant, reliable, and efficient. This philosophy has guided my work, from fine-tuning batch processes to dramatically reduce overnight processing times to architecting scalable data ecosystems. My commitment to continuous learning is demonstrated by my proficiency in modern tools like Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data analysis, visualization and Machine Learning, and my Big Data & Hadoop Certification. Beyond my professional pursuits, my passion for problem-solving extends into my personal life. I find joy in exploring new places, which fuels my curiosity. I believe a curious mind is an active mind, and I am always seeking new knowledge. The opportunity to see my work have a direct, tangible impact is what motivates me. The satisfaction of taking a complex problem, dissecting it with a logical mind, and building a clean, high-performance solution is the essence of my brand. Work Terms Working Hours & Availability I operate on a flexible schedule and am available for real-time collaboration during UK business hours (GMT/BST). I am committed to delivering high-quality work and can adapt my schedule to accommodate client needs and project deadlines. My goal is to be a responsive and reliable partner for your team. Payment Terms & Agreements My preferred payment model is a competitive hourly rate, which can be discussed and agreed upon based on the project's complexity and scope. For long-term engagements, a weekly or bi-weekly payment schedule works best. I am open to utilizing Guru's built-in SafePay system to ensure a secure and transparent payment process for both parties. I will provide clear time-tracking and detailed invoices for all work performed. Communication & Collaboration I believe that clear and consistent communication is the cornerstone of a successful collaboration. My preferred style is direct, proactive, and professional. I am proficient with standard collaboration tools and am comfortable using a variety of platforms to communicate, including written correspondence, instant messaging (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams), and video conferencing (e.g., Google Meet, Zoom) for project meetings and check-ins. I will provide regular updates on my progress and am always available to discuss project goals and potential challenges.
