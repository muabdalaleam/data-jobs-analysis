It is a condition of employment that before a temporary staff member can be appointed, the Organization must have received a security clearance certificate (minimum NATO Secret) from the government of the country or countries of which he/she is a national.
 Important: 
Note that this process is only to be included in our temporary database, and does not constitute a guarantee of employment.

Any questions on this subject should be sent to recruitment@hq.nato.int.

Eligible applicants selected from outside the duty station are responsible for any expenses in connection with their relocation to the duty station. Staff members subject to local recruitment are not eligible for allowances or benefits exclusively applicable to international recruitment. If the selected candidate is a staff member from the United Nations Secretariat, the selection will be administered as a temporary assignment. While this temporary assignment may provide the successful applicant with an opportunity to gain new work experience, the selection for this position is for a limited period and has no bearing on the future incumbency of the post. Subject to the funding source of the position, the eligibility for this temporary job opening may be limited to candidates based at the duty station. This temporary job opening may be limited to ""internal candidates,"" who have been recruited through a competitive examination administered according to staff rule 4.16 or staff selection process including the review of a central review body established according to staff rule 4.15. Staff members of the United Nations common system organizations who will reach the mandatory age of separation or retirement within the duration of the current temporary need period are not eligible to apply.

Retirees above the mandatory age of separation who wish to be considered for the current temporary job opening must indicate the reason for their last separation as ""retirement."" Such retirees shall not be employed by the Organization, unless (a) the operational requirements of the Organization cannot be met by staff members who are qualified and available to perform the required functions; and (b) the proposed employment would not adversely affect the career development or redeployment opportunities of other staff members and represents both a cost effective and operationally sound solution to meet the needs of the service.
United Nations Considerations
According to article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, the paramount consideration in the employment of the staff is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. Candidates will not be considered for employment with the United Nations if they have committed violations of international human rights law, violations of international humanitarian law, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment, or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have been involved in the commission of any of these acts. The term “sexual exploitation” means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment. Due regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. The United Nations places no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs. The United Nations Secretariat is a non-smoking environment. Reasonable accommodation may be provided to applicants with disabilities upon request, to support their participation in the recruitment process. By accepting a letter of appointment, staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General, who may assign them to any of the activities or offices of the United Nations in accordance with staff regulation 1.2 (c). Further, staff members in the Professional and higher category up to and including the D-2 level and the Field Service category are normally required to move periodically to discharge functions in different duty stations under conditions established in ST/AI/2023/3 on Mobility, as may be amended or revised. This condition of service applies to all position specific job openings and does not apply to temporary positions. Applicants are urged to carefully follow all instructions available in the online recruitment platform, inspira, and to refer to the Applicant Guide by clicking on “Manuals” in the “Help” tile of the inspira account-holder homepage. The evaluation of applicants will be conducted on the basis of the information submitted in the application according to the evaluation criteria of the job opening and the applicable internal legislations of the United Nations including the Charter of the United Nations, resolutions of the General Assembly, the Staff Regulations and Rules, administrative issuances and guidelines. Applicants must provide complete and accurate information pertaining to their personal profile and qualifications according to the instructions provided in inspira to be considered for the current job opening.

 (Hybride werken mogelijk + €6.000,- tot €12.000,- p/m)
Krijg je energie van het werken met data en het bouwen van slimme oplossingen? Wil je werken aan uitdagende projecten waar je jouw analytische en technische skills maximaal kunt inzetten, zonder dat je je zorgen hoeft te maken over sales? Dan ben jij de 
Data Engineer 
die we zoeken!
Bij ons werk je samen met een gedreven team aan innovatieve data-oplossingen die direct impact hebben en value opleveren bij onze klanten en partners. Bovendien krijg je de vrijheid om de projecten te kiezen waar je echt enthousiast van wordt. Wil jij liever focussen op het bouwen of aan het optimaliseren? Aan jou de keus.
Wie zijn wij?
FreshMinds is een dynamische en snelgroeiende organisatie gespecialiseerd in IT-consultancy. Met onze teams van experts in Cloud, Data, Security en Software Development streven we naar uitmuntendheid en klanttevredenheid. Wij zetten onze consultants centraal en richten ons op het eerlijk verdelen van de omzet aan ons team.
We Connect
Bij ons draait het om onze mensen. Zij zijn het allerbelangrijkste. Dus zorgen we goed voor ze. Door naar ze te luisteren en met ze mee te denken. Onze consultants krijgen vanaf het begin 1-op-1 coaching. Als zij lekker in hun vel zitten profiteren ook onze klanten daarvan. Sommige collega’s zie je net zo vaak als sommige familieleden. Gelukkig werken we met de leukste en kan je ook nog wat van ze leren.
We Play
We doen in ons werk waar we goed in zijn maar vooral wat we leuk vinden en dat leidt tot resultaten. Daar werken we hard voor maar vieren we misschien nog wel harder, ieder op zijn eigen manier. Van bakken op de jaarlijkse zomer BBQ en pieken op het kerstfeest naar glijden van de piste tijdens de ski reis. Van bordspellen en bierproeverijen tot LAN-party’s op kantoor. Voor ieder wat wils. En mis je toch nog iets? Grijp je kans en initieer en organiseer een leuk event en wie weet wordt daarmee wel een nieuwe FreshMinds traditie geboren.
We Go
De consultants kiezen, na voorselectie, zelf bij welk project zij aan de slag willen. We bieden een onbeperkt opleidingsbudget en organiseren daarnaast regelmatig in-house kennissessies. Mét eten. Mét borrel. Binnen de Freshlance constructie werken we met een 70-30-beloningsstructuur. De consultant ontvangt 70% van wat wij factureren. Die onderhandelingen kunnen ze wel aan ons over laten!
Wat ga je doen?
Stel je voor: je komt binnen bij FreshMinds en voelt direct de dynamiek van een team vol talent en ambitie. Onze salesafdeling heeft, samen met jou, hard gewerkt om een uitdagend project te vinden dat precies bij jouw wensen past – en dat is gelukt! Of het nu gaat om het ontwerpen van een data-architectuur voor een autodeelplatform, het optimaliseren van energieverbruik door slimme data-oplossingen, of het bouwen van een realtime data-analysetool voor een bank 
– elk project biedt jou de kans om jouw vaardigheden naar een hoger niveau te tillen.
We houden van aanpakken en werken in korte, efficiënte sprints, zowel bij klanten op locatie als aan in-house consultancy projecten. Jij zorgt voor de dataverwerking en -integratie, en werkt nauw samen met je collega’s en partners om de voortgang scherp in de gaten te houden. Dankzij jouw ervaring en expertise adviseer je klanten over hoe data slimmer en efficiënter kan worden ingezet om bedrijfsprocessen te verbeteren.

Hier hou jij niet van:
Eentonige routines
: Je volgt niet zomaar de gebaande paden. Je vindt het leuk om nieuwe benaderingen uit te proberen en komt met frisse ideeën die het werk voor jou, je team en je klant slimmer en efficiënter maken.
Slechte data-infrastructuur
: Slecht gestructureerde databases of verouderde pipelines zonder duidelijke documentatie werken je op de zenuwen. Je ziet meteen waar verbeteringen mogelijk zijn en pakt dit grondig aan.

4294949931,"Software Engineer, New Grad","Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland",4 days ago,Stripe,"Who we are
About Stripe
Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.
About The Team
Stripe offers an interesting middle ground between joining a small startup and going to work for a multinational company. We have systems and processes optimized for early-career professionals. You will be in an environment that prizes rigor, discipline, and reliability—from our products, from our ways of working, and from our colleagues. You will learn how the best teams put together extremely reliable systems, and you will be responsible for operating these systems, with adequate backup when things get tough.
What you’ll do
As a company, we believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.
Responsibilities
Work on cross-functional projects, directly collaborating with other engineers
Give meaningful feedback on code reviews and technical designs
Ensure that the systems your team operates continue running well and can scale to meet the needs of our users
Build the skills to own a project from beginning to end, learning project management and technical leadership skills
Who you are
We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.
Minimum Requirements
A Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD degree in computer science or a directly related field, obtained by summer 2026, or equivalent work experience
Some experience and familiarity with programming, either through side projects or classwork. We work mostly in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, and Go. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present
Experience from either previous internships or working collaboratively on multi-person coding projects (in a university or professional setting)
Ability to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts
Preferred Qualifications
One or more areas of specialized knowledge balanced with general skills and knowledge, such as knowing more frontend technologies and, at a high level, how a service handles an HTTP request
Experience in code review practices, and an understanding of how to safely update production systems
Familiarity with navigating and managing work in large code bases
In-office expectations
Office-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.
Pay and benefits
The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is €64,000 - €96,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.
Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.",https://ie.linkedin.com/jobs/view/software-engineer-new-grad-at-stripe-4294949931?trk=public_jobs_topcard-title,https://www.linkedin.com/company/stripe?trk=public_jobs_topcard-org-name,Over 200 applicants,"Software Development, Financial Services, and Technology, Information and Internet",Full-time,Engineering and Information Technology,Entry level,European Union,Data engineer

Joining AND
From the work we deliver, to the way we serve and support our people, we work hard to ensure that there's nowhere quite like AND. But joining a company is a two-way street: the fit has to work on both sides. So before you apply, here's three key things to understand about us:
We're built for people - like, real humans. Not ‘resources' or ‘staff'. That means happiness and wellbeing really do matter to us, and we hate unnecessary hierarchy and bureaucracy.
There's no well-trodden path ahead: AND is growing fast and forging a new trail. That's exciting, and gives us all the autonomy and opportunity we love - but bear in mind it also demands focus, patience and resilience.
Diversity is a priority. After all, to build great products that a wide variety of different people love to use, we need a wide variety of people to help us build them. So diversity is more than a policy or a word: it's business critical for us.",https://nl.linkedin.com/jobs/view/senior-data-engineer-amsterdam-at-and-digital-4294101579?trk=public_jobs_topcard-title,https://uk.linkedin.com/company/and_digital?trk=public_jobs_topcard-org-name,Be among the first 25 applicants,IT Services and IT Consulting,Full-time,Information Technology,Not Applicable,European Union,Data engineer

Work with data governance specialists to uphold privacy-by-design, ethical AI practices, and compliant sharing (e.g., data-use agreements, tiered access).
Contribute to capacity building (playbooks, brown-bags, office hours) with country counterparts and internal teams; promote “build once—reuse many” practices.
Continuously explore and evaluate new tools (including AI/LLMs), keeping a pragmatic focus on impact, robustness, and maintainability
What you'll need
Education: Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Computer/Data Science, or a related quantitative field.
Experience
At least 5 years in data science/analytics/applied research, demonstrating strong skills in statistical modeling, econometrics, machine learning, and quantitative analysis.
Proven experience building data systems and analytical products in international development organizations (e.g., MDBs/UN/INGOs/governments) and/or the private sector (e.g., tech, consulting, civic tech), including work with national statistical offices or government data producers.
Experience integrating traditional and non-traditional data (e.g., surveys + admin + geospatial/mobile) and taking solutions from prototype to pilot/production.
Familiarity with LAC context and working in multilingual, multi-stakeholder environments is highly desirable.

About The Role
Machine Learning Engineers at Cleo work on building novel solutions to real-world problems. This really does vary but could be: creating chatbots to coach our users around their financial health, creating classifiers to better understand transaction data or even optimising transactions within our payments platform.
Ultimately, we’re looking for brilliant Machine Learning Engineers at Mid to Lead levels to join us on our mission to fight for the world's financial health. You’ll be leading technical work within a team of adaptable, creative and product-focused engineers, who train & integrate cutting edge machine learning across a variety of products and deploy them into production for millions of users. We understand our customers, we understand their pain, and we are passionate about helping them.
What You'll Be Doing
Training and fine-tuning models to solve customer problems across our chatbot and the bank transaction data behind it.
Deploying these models into our production environments using our in-house ML platform, which you can read about on our blog: Let's have an Espresso: MLOps at Cleo. Or integrate with LLMs hosted by OpenAI, Anthropic, GCP, AWS and others.
Working cross-functionally with backend engineers, data analysts, UX writers, product managers, annotation teams, and others to ship features that improve our users’ financial health.
Taking the initiative to propose & lead technical work towards problems that were previously unknown or poorly understood. Driving change at the chapter level that affects multiple squads.
Keeping Cleo at the forefront of NLP by driving the adoption of appropriate state-of-the-art techniques and communicating the team’s successes and learnings at the company level & beyond.
Mentoring & advising colleagues on their choices of models, architecture, and evaluation, promoting best practices for how we use LLMs.
Here Are Some Examples, Big And Small, Of The Kinds Of Product Feature Work Our ML Engineers Have Taken Part In Over The Last Year
Building AI Agents to explore and derive insights from users transactional data

What’s more meaningful than seeing the real-world impact of your work?
Ok, maybe ending world hunger, but this is a strong second. 
At OOONO, you’re not just building models in a notebook. You’re shaping the algorithms that directly power a physical product - used in real time by real people in the real world.
You’ll be working in a small, collaborative team alongside other data scientists and data engineers, where you’re trusted to take ownership, test bold ideas, and push things into production. Your work will span a range of approaches—from rule-based logic to advanced analytics and machine learning—always with the focus on delivering real-world product impact.
And you’ll do it side by side with engineers, hardware specialists, and designers who genuinely care - about the product, the users, and each other.
What you’ll be doing
Develop and improve core algorithms to enhance product performance and user experience.
Work on map matching logic and road network analysis to improve location accuracy.
Design, build, and maintain predictive models to solve complex business challenges.
Analyze large-scale datasets from Athena, MongoDB, and other sources to extract actionable insights.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams (Software, Hardware, UX/UI) to implement data-driven solutions.
Experiment with geospatial tools and frameworks to continuously improve analytical workflows.
We imagine you’re someone who has
A Master’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Geoinformatics, Mathematics, Statistics or a similar field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or similar role, ideally within a tech environment.

Strong problem-solving skills and the ability to take projects from idea to delivery.
Comfortable balancing independence with collaboration in a cross-functional setup.
English fluency.
How is it working at OOONO?
We’re glad we asked. It’s a nice working place. As in nice-nice. We have a relaxed, informal atmosphere and a flat hierarchy. Whenever you need a break from your important work stuff, you can get beat in table tennis, foosball, or just smalltalk about the weather by the coffee machine. We have monthly social events where we do anything from go-karting to going to festivals. 
And when we’re not social? Then we’re pretty damn ambitious. We don’t like conservative targets or linear growth. We’re all about the extraordinary. This has led OOONO to become one of the fastest-growing tech scaleups and surprise-surprise: We have no plans of slowing down. So yes, OOONO is a lovely place to work, but it’s also a pretty good opportunity to develop as a person and take the next steps in your career.

As the role is our entry level, this is a great entry point for a career path at Lokad, either as a future technical expert or as manager.
We help companies in different verticals (aerospace, automotive, ecommerce…) to forecast and make decisions about their inventory. The vast majority of our clients are based outside of France, mainly in North America and Europe.
As a Business Data Analyst (or Supply Chain Scientist in Lokad's terminology), your role is to make sure our clients get the most from Lokad's technology. The role is a mix between technology, data crunching and supply chain expertise. You will address complex supply chain issues and craft quantitative strategies. Your goal is not only to advise your clients on strategies to adopt, but to craft and execute these strategies on a daily basis while leveraging the data available as much as possible. Your goal is also to keep refining these strategies over time to keep them aligned with the needs of our clients.
At Lokad, you will benefit from the extensive training and coaching of our expert team. You will gain skills in supply chain, predictive analysis and overall quantitative optimization for business. You will learn how to achieve measurable business results grounded on scientific analysis of data.
About one quarter of your time is spent interacting with clients in order to better understand their business (mainly over the phone or by mail, with occasional travels). Note that, in order to benefit from your colleagues expertise, you won't be required to work on the customers' premises.
The rest of your time is spent on data analysis, including manipulating and cleaning data, setting up forecasts, economic optimization, reporting and data vizualisation. In order to do this, you'll learn to use our Differentiable Programming tools and a DSL (Envision) developped by Lokad.
We are looking for candidates with the following skills and qualities:
A strong engineering background.
A keen interest in data and quantitative analysis in general.
Good Excel skills or programming skills (e.g. Python, VBA, SQL, etc.).
Impeccable command of English 
( French is optional).
Excellent communication skills and telephone manners.
A well-made head, rather than a well-filled head.
 We are not looking for someone who is already an expert in supply chain or programming. We’re looking for a fast learner, with an ability to quickly grasp technology and concepts, since our technology is by no means a simple and plug-and-play product. Knowledge or understanding of supply chain would be a bonus, but the ability to quickly assess and grasp a new situation or get a clear picture of how an organization works and what are the pain points is what we are really after.
Candidates must be self-motivated, confident and highly driven to achieve results with a “hands on” attitude.

4294361692,Applied ML/AI Engineer - Monitoring,"Paris, Île-de-France, France",5 days ago,Sifflet,"About Sifflet
We are building the world’s best data observability platform to help companies excel at data-driven decision making.
Today, half of a data team’s time is spent troubleshooting data quality issues. Sifflet is putting an end to that. Our solution allows data engineers and data consumers to visualize how data flows between their services, define data quality checks, and quickly find the root cause of any data anomaly.
About The Job
The monitoring team implements the foundational capabilities of Sifflet: detecting data quality issues across a wide range of data warehouses and databases.
Sifflet's monitoring capabilities rely heavily on machine learning (ML) techniques. Most advanced data quality checks are based on time series forecasting models that detect unexpected distribution changes while accounting for seasonality and one-off events. Additionally, ML-based features are present throughout our product, be it for intelligent alert grouping, automated incident description, or automated monitor suggestions.
As a machine learning engineer on the monitoring team, you will:
Build automated data profiling systems that learn normal data patterns and detect deviations.
Deploy time series forecasting models that understand data seasonality and business cycles.
Create intelligent alerting systems that reduce noise through ML-powered incident correlation.
Implement generative AI workflows across the product, such as enabling users to describe their monitoring needs in natural language.
Contribute to product decisions and identify areas where adding ML/AI-based features can solve customer pain points.
As we’re a small team, you will be expected to design, implement, deploy and maintain your projects in production, and integrate them with other services. Thus, this role includes a significant software engineering component.
Some projects you could be working on
Automated monitor recommendations based on data profiling metrics.
Automated root cause analysis of any data quality incident, building upon the many sources of metadata Sifflet collects (table lineage, query history, past monitor failures…).
Our stack
The monitoring engine is built with Python 3 and its large data/ML ecosystem (notably PyTorch).
The web API is written in (modern) Java with Spring Boot 3, the web frontend is a VueJS application written in Typescript. You may occasionally need to make minor changes to this code base.
Infrastructure: Kubernetes (AWS EKS clusters), MySQL (on AWS RDS), Temporal for job orchestration
Plus a few supporting services: Gitlab CI, Prometheus/Loki/Grafana, Sentry…
While not directly part of our stack, expect to gain a lot of knowledge on many products in the modern data ecosystem. The subtleties of BigQuery or Snowflake will soon be very familiar to you.
Are we the company you’re looking for?
We have offices in Paris, but we’re very remote friendly - several team members are fully remote.
We offer competitive salary and company equity.
We have experts on many topics, so there’s always someone to help. We also have tech talks where everyone can discuss a cool project or technology.
We’re constantly exposed to the intricacies of the modern data ecosystem - you’ll become very knowledgeable about data engineering and the modern data stack, and about how data is used in enterprises.
Our culture emphasises teamwork to efficiently deliver projects to production.
We’re building a genuinely great product, and we think you’ll love the team!
More than three years of experience in a ML engineer role or equivalent. Hands-on production experience is appreciated.
General knowledge of the “modern data stack” ecosystem, especially data warehouses and databases. You don’t have to know everything upfront of course, you’ll pick up what you need on the job.
Experience with the Python ML ecosystem.
You value ownership of your projects from design to production, and aren’t afraid of taking initiatives.
All written communication at Sifflet is in English, but the engineering team routinely uses French, so some level of fluency in French is required.
None of the people who joined Sifflet perfectly matched the described requirements for the role. If you’re interested in this position but don’t tick all the boxes above, feel free to apply anyway!
A first call with either Benoît (Head of Engineering) or Pierre (Monitoring Team Lead) (30 minutes)
One coding interview and one system design interview (1h30 each)
One call with a product manager (30 minutes)
At this point we generally know if we want to extend an offer, but we're happy to organize additional sessions so you can better know the team and the company.",https://fr.linkedin.com/jobs/view/applied-ml-ai-engineer-monitoring-at-sifflet-4294361692?trk=public_jobs_topcard-title,https://www.linkedin.com/company/sifflet?trk=public_jobs_topcard-org-name,,IT Services and IT Consulting,Full-time,Other,Entry level,European Union,Machine learning

4296640183,"Specialist, Data Entry","New York, NY",2 days ago,Center for Justice Innovation,"THE ORGANIZATION
The Center for Justice Innovation is a community justice organization that centers safety and racial justice. Since our founding in 1996, the Center has partnered with community members, courts, and the people most impacted to create stronger, healthier, more just communities. Our decades of experience in courts and communities, coupled with our field-leading research and practitioner expertise, help us drive justice nationwide in innovative, powerful, and durable ways. For more information on how and where we work, please visit www.innovatingjustice.org.
The Center is a 900-employee, $130 million nonprofit that accomplishes its vision through three pillars of work: creating and scaling operating programs to test new ideas and solve problems, performing original research to determine what works (and what doesn’t), and providing expert assistance and policy guidance to justice reformers around the world.
Operating Programs
The Center’s operating programs, including the award-winning Red Hook Community Justice Center and Midtown Community Justice Center, test new ideas, solve difficult problems, and attempt to achieve systemic change within the justice system. Our projects include community-based violence prevention programs, alternatives to incarceration, reentry initiatives, and court-based initiatives that reduce the use of unnecessary incarceration and promote positive individual and family change. Through this programming, we have produced tangible results like safer streets, reduced incarceration, and improved neighborhood perceptions of justice.
Research
The Center's research teams are staffed with social scientists, data analysts, and lawyers who are academically-trained or have lived experience and who conduct research in the U.S. and globally on diverse criminal-legal system and justice issues. Their work includes evaluating programs and policies; conducting exploratory, community-based studies; and providing research translation and strategic planning for system actors. The Center has published studies on topics including court and jail reform, intimate partner violence, restorative justice, gun violence, reentry, sixth amendment rights, and progressive prosecution. The research teams strive to make their work meaningful and actionable to the communities they work with, policymakers, and practitioners.
Policy & Expert Assistance
The Center provides hands-on, planning and implementation assistance to a wide range of jurisdictions in areas of reform such as problem-solving courts (e.g., community courts, treatment courts, domestic violence courts), tribal justice, reducing incarceration and the use of fines/fees and reducing crime and violence. Our current expert assistance takes many forms, including help with analyzing data, strategic planning and consultation, policy guidance, and hosting site visits to its operating programs in the New York City area.
Center Support
A dedicated support team within the Center ensures the smooth functioning of operations across various domains, including finance, legal, technology, human resources, fundraising, real estate, and communications. Comprising 15% of the organization's staff, these teams provide essential infrastructure support and innovative solutions aligned with the Center's mission and values.
THE OPPORTUNITY
Launched in 1993, the award-winning Midtown Community Justice Center (“MCJC”) is one of the country’s first problem-solving courts. It provides alternatives to fines and jail as a response to low-level crime. Seeking to reduce crime and incarceration and increase public trust in justice, the Midtown Community Justice Center works with neighborhood stakeholders to improve Midtown Manhattan, and to serve the vibrant Midtown community, specifically those in need of services. The court responds creatively to low-level offending, seeking sentences that are restorative to the victim, defendant, and community. Further, the staff engage in ongoing community engagement to promote community wellness and to help connect people in need to voluntary services.
MCJC operates Community First, a peer navigation and street outreach program that offers upstream diversion from arrest and justice system involvement by building supportive relationships with people in need of services and creating linkages to mental health services, housing support, substance use services, and other kinds of social services as needed. Community First receives funding from the New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute under its Expanding Harm Reduction Services for Priority Populations Who Use Drugs grant program.
MCJC is seeking a Temporary Data Entry Specialist. Reporting to the Clinical Director, the Data Entry Specialist will support data entry for the Midtown Community Justice Center’s State Department of Health grant to provide harm reduction services for unhoused people who use drugs.
Responsibilities include but are not limited to:
Transfer program data from Community First’s Salesforce database to the AIRS system;
Work with Community First staff and CJI’s Data Analytics and Applied Research team to ensure accuracy and support responsiveness to funder questions;
Assist with documenting the process of AIRS data entry; and
Additional tasks as necessary
Position Type: 
Temporary part-time working 1-3 hours per week. This position is temporary until December 31, 2025.
Position Location: 
Midtown Manhattan.
Compensation:
 The compensation range for this position is $29.42 - $32.88 per hour based on a 35-hour work week and is commensurate with experience.
The Center for Justice Innovation is an equal opportunity employer committed to fostering an inclusive and diverse workplace.

About Stripe
Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.
About The Team
Stripe offers an interesting middle ground between joining a small startup and going to work for a multinational company. We have systems and processes optimized for early-career professionals. You will be in an environment that prizes rigor, discipline, and reliability—from our products, from our ways of working, and from our colleagues. You will learn how the best teams put together extremely reliable systems, and you will be responsible for operating these systems, with adequate backup when things get tough.
What you’ll do
As a company, we believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.
Responsibilities
Work on cross-functional projects, directly collaborating with other engineers
Give meaningful feedback on code reviews and technical designs
Ensure that the systems your team operates continue running well and can scale to meet the needs of our users
Build the skills to own a project from beginning to end, learning project management and technical leadership skills
Who you are
We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.
Minimum Requirements
A Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in computer science or a directly related field, obtained by summer 2026, or equivalent work experience
Some experience and familiarity with programming, either through side projects or classwork. We work mostly in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, and Go. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present
Experience from either previous internships or working collaboratively on multi-person coding projects (in a university or professional setting)
Ability to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts
Preferred Qualifications
One or more areas of specialized knowledge balanced with general skills and knowledge, such as knowing more frontend technologies and, at a high level, how a service handles an HTTP request
Experience in code review practices, and an understanding of how to safely update production systems
Familiarity with navigating and managing work in large code bases
In-office expectations
Office-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.
Pay and benefits
The annual US base salary range for this role is $122,100 - $134,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.

4297258899,ML/AI Research Engineer — Agentic AI Lab (Founding Team),"San Francisco, CA",4 hours ago,Fabrion,"Location:
 San Francisco Bay Area
Type:
 Full-Time
Compensation:
 Competitive salary + meaningful equity (founding tier)
Backed by 8VC, we're building a world-class team to tackle one of the industry’s most critical infrastructure problems.
About The Role
We’re designing the future of enterprise AI infrastructure — grounded in agents, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), knowledge graphs, and multi-tenant governance.
We’re looking for an 
ML/AI Research Engineer
 to join our AI Lab and lead the design, training, evaluation, and optimization of agent-native AI models. You'll work at the intersection of 
LLMs, vector search, graph reasoning, and reinforcement learning
 — building the intelligence layer that sits on top of our enterprise data fabric.
This isn’t a prompt engineer role. It’s full-cycle ML: from data curation and fine-tuning to evaluation, interpretability, and deployment — with cost-awareness, alignment, and agent coordination all in scope.
Core Responsibilities
Fine-tune and evaluate open-source LLMs (e.g. LLaMA 3, Mistral, Falcon, Mixtral) for enterprise use cases with both structured and unstructured data
Build and optimize RAG pipelines using LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, or Dust — integrated with our vector DBs and internal knowledge graph
Train agent architectures (ReAct, AutoGPT, BabyAGI, OpenAgents) using enterprise task data
Develop embedding-based memory and retrieval chains with token-efficient chunking strategies
Create reinforcement learning pipelines to optimize agent behaviors (e.g. RLHF, DPO, PPO)
Establish scalable evaluation harnesses for LLM and agent performance, including synthetic evals, trace capture, and explainability tools
Contribute to model observability, drift detection, error classification, and alignment
Optimize inference latency and GPU resource utilization across cloud and on-prem environments
Desired Experience
Model Training:
Deep experience fine-tuning open-source LLMs using HuggingFace Transformers, DeepSpeed, vLLM, FSDP, LoRA/QLoRA
Worked with both base and instruction-tuned models; familiar with SFT, RLHF, DPO pipelines
Comfortable building and maintaining custom training datasets, filters, and eval splits
Understand tradeoffs in batch size, token window, optimizer, precision (FP16, bfloat16), and quantization
RAG + Knowledge Graphs:
Experience building enterprise-grade RAG pipelines integrated with real-time or contextual data
Familiar with LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, and open-source vector DBs (Weaviate, Qdrant, FAISS)
Experience grounding models with structured data (SQL, graph, metadata) + unstructured sources
Bonus: Worked with Neo4j, Puppygraph, RDF, OWL, or other semantic modeling systems
Agent Intelligence:
Experience training or customizing agent frameworks with multi-step reasoning and memory
Understand common agent loop patterns (e.g. Plan→Act→Reflect), memory recall, and tools
Familiar with self-correction, multi-agent communication, and agent ops logging
Optimization:
Strong background in token cost optimization, chunking strategies, reranking (e.g. Cohere, Jina), compression, and retrieval latency tuning
Experience running models under quantized (int4/int8) or multi-GPU settings with inference tuning (vLLM, TGI)
Preferred Tech Stack
LLM Training & Inference: HuggingFace Transformers, DeepSpeed, vLLM, FlashAttention, FSDP, LoRA
Agent Orchestration: LangChain, LangGraph, ReAct, OpenAgents, LlamaIndex
Vector DBs: Weaviate, Qdrant, FAISS, Pinecone, Chroma
Graph Knowledge Systems: Neo4j, Puppygraph, RDF, Gremlin, JSON-LD
Storage & Access: Iceberg, DuckDB, Postgres, Parquet, Delta Lake
Evaluation: OpenLLM Evals, Trulens, Ragas, LangSmith, Weight & Biases
Compute: Ray, Kubernetes, TGI, Sagemaker, LambdaLabs, Modal
Languages: Python (core), optionally Rust (for inference layers) or JS (for UX experimentation)
Soft Skills & Mindset
Startup DNA: resourceful, fast-moving, and capable of working in ambiguity
Deep curiosity about agent-based architectures and real-world enterprise complexity
Comfortable owning model performance end-to-end: from dataset to deployment
Strong instincts around explainability, safety, and continuous improvement
Enjoy pair-designing with product and UX to shape capabilities, not just APIs
Why This Role Matters
This role is foundational to our thesis: that 
agents + enterprise data + knowledge modeling
 can create intelligent infrastructure for real-world, multi-billion-dollar workflows. Your work won’t be buried in research reports — it will be productionized and activated by hundreds of users and hundreds of thousands of decisions.
